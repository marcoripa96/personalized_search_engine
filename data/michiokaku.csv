I am not positive, but I think he was never given the Prize for Hawking radiation, which is emitted from a black hole, because it is too faint to measure, and the Nobel Prize committee wants proven results.

Without Jupiter to help clean out the early solar system of asteroid debris, the earth would have been struck repeatedly by them, making life impossible. So Jupiter is like a cosmic vacuum cleaner, clearing the way for life to form.	[]

So we need a large moon to stabilize the earth."	[]
2019-07-24 21:47:32	304	57	Twitter Web App	False	1154146117816397824	Ans. to Riddle 107b. The moon is leaving the earth at about an inch per year. This is due to the tidal forces linking the moon to the earth. So, millions of years from now, there will be no more total solar eclipses.	[]
2019-07-24 21:46:27	252	36	Twitter Web App	False	1154145847753543680	Ans. to Riddle 107a - if a moon gets too close to a large,  planet, tidal forces might be strong enough to squeeze the moon and then rip it apart. This distance is called Roche's limit. Saturn's rings lie just inside Roche's limit, so this might probably explain the its rings.	[]

The intense heat from a  meltdown comes from nuclear waste, created by splitting the uranium atom. Fusion reactors do not have uranium or fission waste, and hence cannot meltdown like uranium reactors.	[]

We are not sure, but one theory says that the oxygen and CO2 content of the air was much higher back then. Oxygen was needed to support their huge mass, and CO2 caused warming so that the dinosaurs had plenty heat to warm up.	[]

This feeling is one of dying, like falling off a cliff in free fall. Also, your eyes say you are stationary, but your inner ear says you are falling, and the mismatch causes sea sickness.	[]

2019-04-06 19:11:14	187	35	Twitter Web Client	False	1114606508585684997	Ans. to Riddle #80. Before Star Trek, many astronomers believed that planet Vulcan, which was between the sun and Mercury, could explain the strange orbit of Mercury. But Einstein disproved that theory, showing that general relativity could explain the slight wobbling of Mercury.	[]
2019-04-06 19:07:44	498	108	Twitter Web Client	False	1114605626259320835	Einstein also faced the same problem: i.e. since gravity is always attractive, never repulsive, the universe must eventually collapse.

2019-04-06 19:05:09	268	58	Twitter Web Client	False	1114604977106968576	But Newton realized there was a problem with his solution.

But under general relativity, time can can speed up due to lower gravity. So relativity both slows down and speeds up time. Both effects are important.	[]

2019-01-24 16:19:55	407	108	Twitter Web Client	False	1088471466306424835	Ans. to Riddle #45. Can a giant solar flare paralyze electronics on earth? Yes. In 1859, the Carrington event burned telegraph wires and the Northern Lights were seen in Cuba. If it happens again, property damage (to power stations, the grid, satellites), would be $2 trillion.

The average velocity of light slows down in glass or water, and subatomic particles can exceed that slower speed, creating a shock wave, creating that eerie green glow found at a nuclear plant.	[]

2019-01-16 15:18:33	377	64	Twitter Web Client	False	1085556920252071936	Ans. to Riddle #40. Einstein predicted that disturbances in the gravity field should travel at the speed of light.

2019-01-16 15:14:08	185	30	Twitter Web Client	False	1085555809445134336	Ans. to Riddle #39. Comet tails are created when the solar wind hits the comet. One tail consists of fast-moving ions, which point directly away from the sun. The other consists of slow-moving particles, which then form a curve as the comet moves in its orbit around the sun.	[]
2019-01-13 04:18:01	483	85	Twitter Web Client	False	1084303530079461376	Ans. to Riddle #38. The north and south pole of the sun flip every 11 years, i.e. the sunspot cycle. When the sun spins, the magnetic lines do not. This is like winding up a spring; eventually the spring gets so wound up that it rapidly unwinds, i.e. the poles interchange.	[]

Microwaves excite the water molecules deep inside your food. Since food is mainly water, this then heats up your dinner. Flames only heat the outside of your food, and then convection heats the inside.	[]

But Leo Szilard proposed that a chain reaction could greatly magnify the energy released from a single uranium atom, making a bomb possible. This changed history.	[]
2019-01-12 21:27:30	476	99	Twitter Web Client	False	1084200220538400768	Ans. to Riddle #34. Why is Venus so hot? Because its atmosphere  is almost pure carbon dioxide, and because it is closer to the sun, it has a runaway greenhouse effect on a planetary scale, with a temperature of 900 degrees. Carl Sagan was of the first to predict this.	[]
